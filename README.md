## Squad
This app that allows you to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes (or any other character-type of your choosing).

As seen on [link](https://squad-moringaip.herokuapp.com/)
**Specs**
- **_Hero_** _object_: Has a name, age, special power and weakness. Special powers and weaknesses could be freely assignable or you may offer users a pre-determined set to choose from.

- **_Squad_** _object_: Has a max size, name, and a cause they're are dedicated to fighting (sexism, computer illiteracy, not covering your mouth when you sneeze, hogging bus seats with your backpack, passive aggressive post-it notes, etc).

- Allows users to assign Heros to a Squad. Each hero can only participate in one Squad at a time.

- You could even calculate scores for a specific skill area for your squad (defense, distance attacks, etc), or begin to integrate a turn-based battle system. Get creative! This could be the start of a fun portfolio piece!
